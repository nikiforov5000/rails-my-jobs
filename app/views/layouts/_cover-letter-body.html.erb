Re: Application for the position of <%= @job.title.downcase %>. 
<br>
Dear <%= @cover_letter.staff_name %>,
    I would like to apply for the position of <%= @job.title.downcase %> as advertised 
    on <%= link_to @cover_letter.platform, @job.url %>. With my technical background, 
    during the bootcamp I developed a strong preference for backend development. It feels 
    more logical, and somehow more powerful! I like the idea of processing data, and I want 
    to help the user gets what he wants as quickly and effectively as possible, even if the 
    user doesn’t how much hard work it takes behind the scenes! During my career in advertising, 
    I noticed that highly organized and dedicated people are more likely to achieve their goals.
     That’s my philosophy, and that’s why my clients have always been so loyal to me.  
    During the bootcamp I helped to build three web applications, and I discovered that my organization skills helped a lot
    Most recently, I was [talk about your major accomplishments in software development or design.]
I am impressed with <%= @job.company %>' achievements
and feel that my motivation and passion with backend and good frontend would be of great benefit to <%= @job.company %>.
Please find my resume attached. Feel free to contact me if you have any further questions 
you would like to discuss.
<br>
Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. I look forward to hearing from you.
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>
Boris
